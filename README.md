### Start

After the dataset has been prepared, we could run the follow command to train.
> python train.py

### Dependencies
We use python to build our code, you need to install those package to run
+ Python 3.8
+ Pytorch 2.3.1
+ torchvision 0.18.1
+ CUDA 11.8

### Training

Before training, you need to download the MIRFLICKR-25K dataset from https://press.liacs.nl/mirflickr/mirdownload.html, NUS-WIDE dataset from https://opendatalab.org.cn/OpenDataLab/NUS-WIDE and MS COCO dataset from https://cocodataset.org/.
